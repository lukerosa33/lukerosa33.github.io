                        Hi, my name is Luke, and I’m a second year at the University of Chicago. As an economics major, I’ve centered much of my efforts towards finance, interning with a small investment firm over the summer and involving myself in various business groups on campus. As I came into my second year here, 
                        I began to recognize the importance of emerging blockchain technology, especially with its applications in finance. I began diving deep into DeFi; reading, listening, talking to people in the space, anything I could do to better my understanding of the tech. As I’ve learned more, I’ve only increased 
                        my excitement about the future of crypto and web 3.0. Not only does it give indiscriminate access to financial instruments for anyone with an internet connection, but it also allows for the creation of entirely new systems and strategies that have never been seen before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a few months, I’m now participating in a DAO, researching and writing for an analytics protocol, and have co-founded the first blockchain RSO at UChicago. I also consider myself a certified NFT degen. Naturally, I’ve dabbled on the technical side of things (very basic Solidity and JavaScript), 
                        and I’ve added a data science minor to my studies. I probably spend at least 3 hours a day just reading DeFi articles and twitter threads, and I typically can’t help myself from checking Discord and crypto Twitter every five minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m currently looking for positions with anything from venture capital to web 3.0 startups. I’m incredibly driven to learn, build, and grow within this space, and I am so excited to be a part of such incredible innovations in technology.
